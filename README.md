# WorkShare

-----------------RUNS ONLY ON WINDOWS--------------------

REQUIREMENTS:-

-> Apache Tomcat , RECOMMENDED VERSION: 10 or above

-> JDK (Java Development Kit) , RECOMMENDED VERSION: 8.x or the version which supports your Apache Tomcat version
   
----------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO SETUP:-

-> Install JDK (Java Development Kit) from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

-> Now set an enviroment variable called JAVA_HOME to your JDK Directory, if it already exists and pointed to your JRE Directory change it to your JDK Directory and if it is already pointing to a JDK Installation ignore this step. This step is important because WorkShare uses some executables which are available in JDK and not in JRE.

-> Setup Apache Tomcat on your server , documentaion for help https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.0-doc/index.html.
